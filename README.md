# Handwritten Digit Recognition Model

This repository contains a machine learning model for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is implemented in Python and utilizes libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning. 

## Contents

- `app.py`: A Flask web application that allows users to upload handwritten digit images and get predictions.
- `Handwritten Digit Recognization.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook detailing the model training process, data exploration, and evaluation metrics.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip

## Clone
```
https://github.com/pythonophile/Hand_Written_Digit_Recognition_Model
cd Hand_Written_Digit_Recognition_Model
```
### Run
```streamlit run app.py```

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of over 96% on the MNIST test dataset. For detailed performance metrics, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook.
